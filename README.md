# Spotify Lyrics Finder

In this project, I have created a flutter app to get the lyrics of the song you are currently listening to on Spotify. This works by connecting with your Spotify account. The lyrics are being fetched from Genius API.

### Getting Started
run <br/>
`flutter pub get` and then <br/>
`flutter run`
